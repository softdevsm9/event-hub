# EventHub

EventHub is a full stack web application inspired by Eventbrite. It was built using Ruby on Rails on the backend, a PostgreSQL database, and React.js with Redux architecture on the front end.

The application allows users to create events, browse events, and register for event tickets.

## Technologies Used

* Ruby on Rails
* React.js / Redux
* jBuilder
* HTML5
* CSS3

Ruby on Rails is a back-end MVC framework that was used to build a RESTful api and for data-fetching from a PostgreSQL database.

The front end application was written using Javascript's React library for reuseable, modular code. It was used in conjunction with the Redux framework to add in the benefits of a unidirectional data flow which made the application easier to debug.

## Features and Implementation

### Front-Page Events Overview

### Event Categories

### Ticket Registrations / Bookmarking

### Search

### Google Maps API

## Future Implementations

### Search Bar Improvements

Currently, users are only able to search for events from the home screen. In order to improve UX, a search bar should be visible at all time. Future plans include adding a search bar to the navbar when the user navigates away from the home component. Other ideas include autocomplete and search suggestions when the user starts typing.

### Tags

Similar to the actual Evenbrite site, users should be able to assign personalized tags to events. These tags will enhance search and filter capabilities.

### Calendar

The addition of a calendar would tremendously improve UX. Users would be able to sort and filter events by date. This will help users avoid date / time conflict when booking events.
